manages memory.\nAll programs have to manage the way they use a computer’s memory while running.\nSome languages have garbage collection that regularly looks for no-longer-used\nmemory as the program runs; in other languages, the programmer must explicitly\nallocate and free the memory. Rust uses a third approach: memory is managed\nthrough a system of ownership with a set of rules that the compiler checks. If\nany of the rules are violated, the program won’t compile. None of the features\nof ownership will slow down your program while it’s running.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Because ownership is a new concept for many programmers, it does take some time\nto get used to. The good news is that the more experienced you become with Rust\nand the rules of the ownership system, the easier you’ll find it to naturally\ndevelop code that is safe and efficient. Keep at it!</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">When you understand ownership, you’ll have a solid foundation for understanding\nthe features that make Rust unique. In this chapter, you’ll learn ownership by\nworking through some examples that focus on a very common data structure:\nstrings.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3 tabindex=\"-1\" id=\"user-content-the-stack-and-the-heap\" dir=\"auto\"><a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#the-stack-and-the-heap\">The Stack and the Heap<svg class=\"octicon octicon-link\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" version=\"1.1\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><path d=\"m7.775 3.275 1.25-1.25a3.5 3.5 0 1 1 4.95 4.95l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 0 1-4.95 0 .751.751 0 0 1 .018-1.042.751.751 0 0 1 1.042-.018 1.998 1.998 0 0 0 2.83 0l2.5-2.5a2.002 2.002 0 0 0-2.83-2.83l-1.25 1.25a.751.751 0 0 1-1.042-.018.751.751 0 0 1-.018-1.042Zm-4.69 9.64a1.998 1.998 0 0 0 2.83 0l1.25-1.25a.751.751 0 0 1 1.042.018.751.751 0 0 1 .018 1.042l-1.25 1.25a3.5 3.5 0 1 1-4.95-4.95l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 0 1 4.95 0 .751.751 0 0 1-.018 1.042.751.751 0 0 1-1.042.018 1.998 1.998 0 0 0-2.83 0l-2.5 2.5a1.998 1.998 0 0 0 0 2.83Z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Many programming languages don’t require you to think about the stack and the\nheap very often. But in a systems programming language like Rust, whether a\nvalue is on the stack or the heap affects how the language behaves and why\nyou have to make certain decisions. Parts of ownership will be described in\nrelation to the stack and the heap later in this chapter, so here is a brief\nexplanation in preparation.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Both the stack and the heap are parts of memory available to your code to use\nat runtime, but they are structured in different ways. The stack stores\nvalues in the order it gets them and removes the values in the opposite\norder. This is referred to as <em>last in, first out</em>. Think of a stack of\nplates: when you add more plates, you put them on top of the pile, and when\nyou need a plate, you take one off the top. Adding or removing plates from\nthe middle or bottom wouldn’t work as well! Adding data is called <em>pushing\nonto the stack</em>, and removing data is called <em>popping off the stack</em>. All\ndata stored on the stack must have a known, fixed size. Data with an unknown\nsize at compile time or a size that might change must be stored on the heap\ninstead.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">The heap is less organized: when you put data on the heap, you request a\ncertain amount of space. The memory allocator finds an empty spot in the heap\nthat is big enough, marks it as being in use, and returns a <em>pointer</em>, which\nis the address of that location. This process is called <em>allocating on the\nheap</em> and is sometimes abbreviated as just <em>allocating</em> (pushing values onto\nthe stack is not considered allocating). Because the pointer to the heap is a\nknown, fixed size, you can store the pointer on the stack, but when you want\nthe actual data, you must follow the pointer. Think of being seated at a\nrestaurant. When you enter, you state the number of people in your group, and\nthe host finds an empty table that fits everyone and leads you there. If\nsomeone in your group comes late, they can ask where you’ve been seated to\nfind you.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Pushing to the stack is faster than allocating on the heap because the\nallocator never has to search for a place to store new data; that location is\nalways at the top of the stack. Comparatively, allocating space on the heap\nrequires more work because the allocator must first find a big enough space\nto hold the data and then perform bookkeeping to prepare for the next\nallocation.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Accessing data in the heap is slower than accessing data on the stack because\nyou have to follow a pointer to get there. Contemporary processors are faster\nif they jump around less in memory. Continuing the analogy, consider a server\nat a restaurant taking orders from many tables. It’s most efficient to get\nall the orders at one table before moving on to the next table. Taking an\norder from table A, then an order from table B, then one from A again, and\nthen one from B again would be a much slower process. By the same token, a\nprocessor can do its job better if it works on data that’s close to other\ndata (as it is on the stack) rather than farther away (as it can be on the\nheap).</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">When your code calls a function, the values passed into the function\n(including, potentially, pointers to data on the heap) and the function’s\nlocal variables get pushed onto the stack.

As a result, our examples will be a\nbit more concise, letting us focus on the actual details rather than\nboilerplate code.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">As a first example of ownership, we’ll look at the <em>scope</em> of some variables.

The variable is valid from the point at\nwhich it’s declared until the end of the current <em>scope</em>. Listing 4-1 shows a\nprogram with comments annotating where the variable <code>s</code> would be valid.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-rust notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\" dir=\"auto\" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=\"{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch04-understanding-ownership/listing-04-01/src/main.rs:here}}\"><pre><span class=\"pl-kos\">{</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">{</span>#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch04-understanding-ownership/listing-<span class=\"pl-c1\">04</span>-<span class=\"pl-c1\">01</span>/src/main<span class=\"pl-kos\">.</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">rs</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">:</span>here<span class=\"pl-kos\">}</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">}</span></pre></div>\n<p dir=\"auto\"><span>Listing 4-1: A variable and the scope in which it is\nvalid</span></p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">In other words, there are two important points in time here:</p>\n<ul dir=\"auto\">\n<li>When <code>s</code> comes <em>into</em> scope, it is valid.</li>\n<li>It remains valid until it goes <em>out of</em> scope.</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"auto\">At this point, the relationship between scopes and when variables are valid is\nsimilar to that in other programming languages.

The types covered previously are of a known size, can be stored\non the stack and popped off the stack when their scope is over, and can be\nquickly and trivially copied to make a new, independent instance if another\npart of code needs to use the same value in a different scope. But we want to\nlook at data that is stored on the heap and explore how Rust knows when to\nclean up that data, and the <code>String</code> type is a great example.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">We’ll concentrate on the parts of <code>String</code> that relate to ownership. These\naspects also apply to other complex data types, whether they are provided by\nthe standard library or created by you. We’ll discuss <code>String</code> in more depth in\n<a href=\"/rust-lang/book/blob/main/src/ch08-02-strings.html\">Chapter 8</a>.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">We’ve already seen string literals, where a string value is hardcoded into our\nprogram. String literals are convenient, but they aren’t suitable for every\nsituation in which we may want to use text. One reason is that they’re\nimmutable. Another is that not every string value can be known when we write\nour code: for example, what if we want to take user input and store it? For\nthese situations, Rust has a second string type, <code>String</code>. This type manages\ndata allocated on the heap and as such is able to store an amount of text that\nis unknown to us at compile time. You can create a <code>String</code> from a string\nliteral using the <code>from</code> function, like so:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-rust notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\" dir=\"auto\" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=\"let s = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);\"><pre><span class=\"pl-k\">let</span> s = <span class=\"pl-smi\">String</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">::</span><span class=\"pl-en\">from</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">(</span><span class=\"pl-s\">\"hello\"</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">)</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">;</span></pre></div>\n<p dir=\"auto\">The double colon <code>::</code> operator allows us to namespace this particular <code>from</code>\nfunction under the <code>String</code> type rather than using some sort of name like\n<code>string_from</code>. We’ll discuss this syntax more in the <a href=\"/rust-lang/book/blob/main/src/ch05-03-method-syntax.html#method-syntax\">“Method\nSyntax”</a> section of Chapter 5, and when we talk\nabout namespacing with modules in <a href=\"/rust-lang/book/blob/main/src/ch07-03-paths-for-referring-to-an-item-in-the-module-tree.html\">“Paths for Referring to an Item in the\nModule Tree”</a> in Chapter 7.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">This kind of string <em>can</em> be mutated:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-rust notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\" dir=\"auto\" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=\"{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch04-understanding-ownership/no-listing-01-can-mutate-string/src/main.rs:here}}\"><pre><span class=\"pl-kos\">{</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">{</span>#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch04-understanding-ownership/no-listing-<span class=\"pl-c1\">01</span>-can-mutate-string/src/main<span class=\"pl-kos\">.</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">rs</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">:</span>here<span class=\"pl-kos\">}</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">}</span></pre></div>\n<p dir=\"auto\">So, what’s the difference here?

This is why string\nliterals are fast and efficient. But these properties only come from the string\nliteral’s immutability. Unfortunately, we can’t put a blob of memory into the\nbinary for each piece of text whose size is unknown at compile time and whose\nsize might change while running the program.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">With the <code>String</code> type, in order to support a mutable, growable piece of text,\nwe need to allocate an amount of memory on the heap, unknown at compile time,\nto hold the contents. This means:</p>\n<ul dir=\"auto\">\n<li>The memory must be requested from the memory allocator at runtime.</li>\n<li>We need a way of returning this memory to the allocator when we’re done with\nour <code>String</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"auto\">That first part is done by us: when we call <code>String::from</code>, its implementation\nrequests the memory it needs. This is pretty much universal in programming\nlanguages.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">However, the second part is different. In languages with a <em>garbage collector\n(GC)</em>, the GC keeps track of and cleans up memory that isn’t being used\nanymore, and we don’t need to think about it. In most languages without a GC,\nit’s our responsibility to identify when memory is no longer being used and to\ncall code to explicitly free it, just as we did to request it. Doing this\ncorrectly has historically been a difficult programming problem. If we forget,\nwe’ll waste memory. If we do it too early, we’ll have an invalid variable. If\nwe do it twice, that’s a bug too. We need to pair exactly one <code>allocate</code> with\nexactly one <code>free</code>.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Rust takes a different path: the memory is automatically returned once the\nvariable that owns it goes out of scope. Here’s a version of our scope example\nfrom Listing 4-1 using a <code>String</code> instead of a string literal:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-rust notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\" dir=\"auto\" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=\"{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch04-understanding-ownership/no-listing-02-string-scope/src/main.rs:here}}\"><pre><span class=\"pl-kos\">{</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">{</span>#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch04-understanding-ownership/no-listing-<span class=\"pl-c1\">02</span>-string-scope/src/main<span class=\"pl-kos\">.</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">rs</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">:</span>here<span class=\"pl-kos\">}</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">}</span></pre></div>\n<p dir=\"auto\">There is a natural point at which we can return the memory our <code>String</code> needs\nto the allocator: when <code>s</code> goes out of scope. When a variable goes out of\nscope, Rust calls a special function for us. This function is called\n<a href=\"/rust-lang/book/blob/main/std/ops/trait.Drop.html#tymethod.drop\"><code>drop</code></a>, and it’s where the author of <code>String</code> can put\nthe code to return the memory. Rust calls <code>drop</code> automatically at the closing\ncurly bracket.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Note: In C++, this pattern of deallocating resources at the end of an item’s\nlifetime is sometimes called <em>Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII)</em>.\nThe <code>drop</code> function in Rust will be familiar to you if you’ve used RAII\npatterns.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"auto\">This pattern has a profound impact on the way Rust code is written. It may seem\nsimple right now, but the behavior of code can be unexpected in more\ncomplicated situations when we want to have multiple variables use the data\nwe’ve allocated on the heap. Let’s explore some of those situations now.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"auto\"><a id=\"user-content-ways-variables-and-data-interact-move\"></a></p>\n<h4 tabindex=\"-1\" id=\"user-content-variables-and-data-interacting-with-move\" dir=\"auto\"><a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#variables-and-data-interacting-with-move\">Variables and Data Interacting with Move<svg class=\"octicon octicon-link\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" version=\"1.1\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><path d=\"m7.775 3.275 1.25-1.25a3.5 3.5 0 1 1 4.95 4.95l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 0 1-4.95 0 .751.751 0 0 1 .018-1.042.751.751 0 0 1 1.042-.018 1.998 1.998 0 0 0 2.83 0l2.5-2.5a2.002 2.002 0 0 0-2.83-2.83l-1.25 1.25a.751.751 0 0 1-1.042-.018.751.751 0 0 1-.018-1.042Zm-4.69 9.64a1.998 1.998 0 0 0 2.83 0l1.25-1.25a.751.751 0 0 1 1.042.018.751.751 0 0 1 .018 1.042l-1.25 1.25a3.5 3.5 0 1 1-4.95-4.95l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 0 1 4.95 0 .751.751 0 0 1-.018 1.042.751.751 0 0 1-1.042.018 1.998 1.998 0 0 0-2.83 0l-2.5 2.5a1.998 1.998 0 0 0 0 2.83Z\"></path></svg></a></h4>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Multiple variables can interact with the same data in different ways in Rust.\nLet’s look at an example using an integer in Listing 4-2.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-rust notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\" dir=\"auto\" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=\"{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch04-understanding-ownership/listing-04-02/src/main.rs:here}}\"><pre><span class=\"pl-kos\">{</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">{</span>#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch04-understanding-ownership/listing-<span class=\"pl-c1\">04</span>-<span class=\"pl-c1\">02</span>/src/main<span class=\"pl-kos\">.</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">rs</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">:</span>here<span class=\"pl-kos\">}</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">}</span></pre></div>\n<p dir=\"auto\"><span>Listing 4-2: Assigning the integer value of variable <code>x</code>\nto <code>y</code></span></p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">We can probably guess what this is doing: “bind the value <code>5</code> to <code>x</code>; then make\na copy of the value in <code>x</code> and bind it to <code>y</code>.” We now have two variables, <code>x</code>\nand <code>y</code>, and both equal <code>5</code>.

A <code>String</code> is made up of three parts, shown on the left: a pointer to\nthe memory that holds the contents of the string, a length, and a capacity.\nThis group of data is stored on the stack.

But\nFigure 4-2 shows both data pointers pointing to the same location. This is a\nproblem: when <code>s2</code> and <code>s1</code> go out of scope, they will both try to free the\nsame memory. This is known as a <em>double free</em> error and is one of the memory\nsafety bugs we mentioned previously. Freeing memory twice can lead to memory\ncorruption, which can potentially lead to security vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">To ensure memory safety, after the line <code>let s2 = s1;</code>, Rust considers <code>s1</code> as\nno longer valid. Therefore, Rust doesn’t need to free anything when <code>s1</code> goes\nout of scope.

But\nbecause Rust also invalidates the first variable, instead of being called a\nshallow copy, it’s known as a <em>move</em>. In this example, we would say that <code>s1</code>\nwas <em>moved</em> into <code>s2</code>.

That means there’s no reason we would want to prevent <code>x</code> from being\nvalid after we create the variable <code>y</code>. In other words, there’s no difference\nbetween deep and shallow copying here, so calling <code>clone</code> wouldn’t do anything\ndifferent from the usual shallow copying, and we can leave it out.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Rust has a special annotation called the <code>Copy</code> trait that we can place on\ntypes that are stored on the stack, as integers are (we’ll talk more about\ntraits in <a href=\"/rust-lang/book/blob/main/src/ch10-02-traits.html\">Chapter 10</a>). If a type implements the <code>Copy</code>\ntrait, variables that use it do not move, but rather are trivially copied,\nmaking them still valid after assignment to another variable.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Rust won’t let us annotate a type with <code>Copy</code> if the type, or any of its parts,\nhas implemented the <code>Drop</code> trait. If the type needs something special to happen\nwhen the value goes out of scope and we add the <code>Copy</code> annotation to that type,\nwe’ll get a compile-time error. To learn about how to add the <code>Copy</code> annotation\nto your type to implement the trait, see <a href=\"/rust-lang/book/blob/main/src/appendix-03-derivable-traits.html\">“Derivable\nTraits”</a> in Appendix C.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">So, what types implement the <code>Copy</code> trait? You can check the documentation for\nthe given type to be sure, but as a general rule, any group of simple scalar\nvalues can implement <code>Copy</code>, and nothing that requires allocation or is some\nform of resource can implement <code>Copy</code>. Here are some of the types that\nimplement <code>Copy</code>:</p>\n<ul dir=\"auto\">\n<li>All the integer types, such as <code>u32</code>.</li>\n<li>The Boolean type, <code>bool</code>, with values <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>.</li>\n<li>All the floating-point types, such as <code>f64</code>.</li>\n<li>The character type, <code>char</code>.</li>\n<li>Tuples, if they only contain types that also implement <code>Copy</code>.
